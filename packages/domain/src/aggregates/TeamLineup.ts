/**
 * Team lineup aggregate root for managing softball team rosters and batting orders.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The TeamLineup aggregate is responsible for comprehensive team management in softball,
 * including player roster management, batting order maintenance, defensive positioning,
 * and enforcement of softball-specific substitution rules.
 *
 * **Core Responsibilities:**
 * - **Player Management**: Add players with unique jersey numbers and positions
 * - **Batting Order**: Maintain batting slot assignments with configurable limits (per SoftballRules)
 * - **Defensive Alignment**: Track field position assignments and changes
 * - **Substitution Rules**: Enforce starter re-entry rules and substitution constraints
 * - **Event Sourcing**: Emit domain events for all state changes
 * - **Rule Validation**: Prevent invalid lineup configurations and rule violations
 *
 * **Softball-Specific Business Rules:**
 * - **Batting Slots**: Support configurable player limits (standard 10 + Extra Players per SoftballRules.maxPlayersPerTeam)
 * - **Jersey Numbers**: Must be unique within team, typically 1-99 range
 * - **Re-entry Rule**: Original starters can re-enter the game once after substitution
 * - **Position Coverage**: Track defensive positions, multiple players can be EXTRA_PLAYER
 * - **Substitution Permanence**: Non-starters cannot re-enter once substituted out
 *
 * **Event Sourcing Architecture:**
 * - All lineup changes generate immutable domain events
 * - Complete audit trail of all roster modifications
 * - Supports undo/redo functionality through event replay
 * - Enables coordination with Game aggregate and external systems
 *
 * **Multi-Aggregate Coordination:**
 * - Coordinates with Game aggregate for game-wide lineup validation
 * - Publishes events that may affect inning progression and scoring
 * - Maintains consistency with softball rule enforcement across aggregates
 *
 * **Data Integrity Guarantees:**
 * - No duplicate players in multiple batting slots simultaneously
 * - Jersey number uniqueness within team roster
 * - Field position coverage constraints (except EXTRA_PLAYER)
 * - Proper batting slot range validation (1-20)
 * - Re-entry rule enforcement for starters vs substitutes
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create new team lineup
 * const lineup = TeamLineup.createNew(
 *   TeamLineupId.generate(),
 *   GameId.generate(),
 *   'Springfield Tigers'
 * );
 *
 * // Add starting players
 * let updatedLineup = lineup
 *   .addPlayer(pitcher, new JerseyNumber(1), 'John Pitcher', 1, FieldPosition.PITCHER)
 *   .addPlayer(catcher, new JerseyNumber(2), 'Jane Catcher', 2, FieldPosition.CATCHER);
 *
 * // Handle substitution with re-entry tracking
 * updatedLineup = updatedLineup.substitutePlayer(
 *   1, pitcher, reliefPitcher, new JerseyNumber(99), 'Relief Pitcher', FieldPosition.PITCHER, 5
 * );
 *
 * // Check re-entry eligibility
 * if (updatedLineup.isPlayerEligibleForReentry(pitcher)) {
 *   // Original starter can re-enter
 *   updatedLineup = updatedLineup.substitutePlayer(
 *     1, reliefPitcher, pitcher, new JerseyNumber(1), 'John Pitcher', FieldPosition.PITCHER, 8, true
 *   );

 * if (updatedLineup.isLineupValid()) {

   * @throws {DomainError} When events are invalid or inconsistent

   * **Event Sourcing Reconstruction Process:**
   * - Validates events array for completeness and consistency
   * - Ensures first event is TeamLineupCreated to establish identity
   * - Verifies all events belong to the same team lineup and game
   * - Creates base lineup instance from creation event
   * - Applies remaining events sequentially to reconstruct state
   * - Sets correct aggregate version based on event count
   * - Ensures no uncommitted events (all events are considered committed)
   *
   * **Supported Event Types:**
   * - **TeamLineupCreated**: Establishes lineup identity and team name
   * - **PlayerAddedToLineup**: Adds players to batting slots and field positions
   * - **PlayerSubstitutedIntoGame**: Handles player substitutions and re-entry tracking
   * - **FieldPositionChanged**: Updates player defensive positions
   *
   * **Business Rule Enforcement:**
   * - All domain invariants are maintained during reconstruction
   * - Player participation history is accurately tracked
   * - Substitution and re-entry rules are properly applied
   * - Field position assignments remain consistent
   * - Jersey number uniqueness is preserved
   *
   * **State Consistency Guarantees:**
   * - Batting order reflects all substitutions and changes
   * - Field positions match final defensive assignments
   * - Player eligibility for re-entry is correctly calculated

   * **Supported Event Types:**
   * - **PlayerAddedToLineup**: Adds player to batting slot and field position
   * - **PlayerSubstitutedIntoGame**: Updates batting slot, field position, and participation history
   * - **FieldPositionChanged**: Updates player's defensive position assignment
   *
   * **State Reconstruction Logic:**
   * - Maintains all internal maps (batting slots, field positions, player history, jerseys)
   * - Preserves domain invariants without validation overhead
   * - Tracks player participation, substitutions, and re-entry eligibility
   * - Handles EXTRA_PLAYER position logic correctly
   *
   * **Value Object Reconstruction:**
   * - When events are deserialized from storage, value objects become plain objects
   * - This method reconstructs PlayerId, JerseyNumber, and other value objects
   * - Ensures .equals() and other value object methods are available
   *
   * **Error Handling:**
   * - Unknown event types are ignored to support forward compatibility
   * - Invalid event data may cause reconstruction failures
   * - Events must be applied in chronological order for correct state
