/**
 * @file RecordAtBat
 * Use case for recording at-bat results and updating game state across all aggregates.
 *
 * @remarks
 * RecordAtBat is a core use case that orchestrates the complex process of recording
 * a plate appearance outcome in a softball game. This involves coordinating multiple
 * domain aggregates (Game, TeamLineup, InningState), calculating derived statistics
 * (RBI, runs scored), generating domain events, and ensuring data consistency.
 *
 * **Business Process Flow**:
 * 1. **Validation**: Verify game exists, is in progress, and batter is valid
 * 2. **State Loading**: Load all relevant aggregates (Game, lineups, inning state)
 * 3. **Domain Coordination**: Apply at-bat result to appropriate aggregates
 * 4. **Statistics Calculation**: Calculate RBIs, runs scored, and other derived stats
 * 5. **Event Generation**: Create domain events for all state changes
 * 6. **Persistence**: Save updated aggregates and store events atomically
 * 7. **Result Assembly**: Build comprehensive result DTO for presentation layer
 *
 * **Key Responsibilities**:
 * - **Cross-aggregate coordination**: Updates Game, TeamLineup, and InningState
 * - **Event sourcing**: Generates and persists domain events for audit trail
 * - **Statistics calculation**: Uses RBICalculator and other domain services
 * - **Error handling**: Provides detailed error information for troubleshooting
 * - **Audit logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
 *
 * **Design Patterns**:
 * - **Hexagonal Architecture**: Uses ports for infrastructure dependencies
 * - **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain model coordination
 * - **Command-Query Separation**: Command input, result output
 * - **Event Sourcing**: All changes recorded as domain events
 * - **Dependency Injection**: Testable with mocked dependencies
 *
 * **Error Handling Strategy**:
 * - Input validation with detailed error messages
 * - Domain rule violations caught and translated
 * - Infrastructure failures (database, event store) handled gracefully
 * - All errors logged with full context for debugging
 * - Failed operations leave system in consistent state
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Service setup with dependency injection
 * const recordAtBat = new RecordAtBat(
 *   gameRepository,
 *   eventStore,
 *   logger
 * );
 *
 * // Record a home run with bases loaded
 * const command: RecordAtBatCommand = {
 *   gameId: GameId.create('game-123'),
 *   batterId: PlayerId.create('player-456'),
 *   result: AtBatResultType.HOME_RUN,
 *   runnerAdvances: [
 *     // Batter and all runners advance to HOME
 *     { playerId: batterId, fromBase: null, toBase: 'HOME', advanceReason: 'BATTED_BALL' },
 *     { playerId: runner1Id, fromBase: 'FIRST', toBase: 'HOME', advanceReason: 'BATTED_BALL' },
 *     { playerId: runner2Id, fromBase: 'SECOND', toBase: 'HOME', advanceReason: 'BATTED_BALL' },
 *     { playerId: runner3Id, fromBase: 'THIRD', toBase: 'HOME', advanceReason: 'BATTED_BALL' }
 *   ],
 *   notes: 'Grand slam over center field fence',
 *   timestamp: new Date()
 * };
 *
 * const result = await recordAtBat.execute(command);
 *
 * if (result.success) {
 *   console.log(`Recorded ${result.runsScored} runs, ${result.rbiAwarded} RBI`);
 *   if (result.gameEnded) {
 *     console.log('Game completed!');
 *   }
 * } else {
 *   console.error('At-bat recording failed:', result.errors);
 * }
 * ```

 * This use case implements the complete business process for recording a plate

 * through event sourcing.
 *
 * **Architecture Integration**:
 * - **Application Layer**: Orchestrates domain operations and infrastructure calls
 * - **Domain Layer**: Uses aggregates, services, and events for business logic
 * - **Infrastructure Layer**: Accessed through ports for persistence and logging
 *
 * **Concurrency Considerations**:
 * - Optimistic locking through event store version checking
 * - Atomic operations for cross-aggregate consistency
 * - Error handling prevents partial state updates
 *
 * **Performance Considerations**:
 * - Efficient aggregate loading and caching
 * - Batch event generation and storage
 * - Minimal domain object allocations
 * - Structured logging with level checking
 *
 * The use case follows the Command pattern with comprehensive error handling
 * and detailed audit logging for production monitoring and debugging.
