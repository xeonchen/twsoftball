# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**TW Softball** - A slow-pitch softball game recording Progressive Web App (PWA)
with offline-first capabilities, built using Hexagonal Architecture, Dependency
Injection Container, and Event Sourcing patterns.

## Quick Reference (AI: Read This First)

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Always Follow These Rules

- **ALWAYS use TodoWrite** for task tracking and progress management
- **ALWAYS run commit-readiness-reviewer** before any git commit
- **ALWAYS complete Post-Commit Checklist** after EVERY commit
- **ALWAYS typecheck, lint, format, and test** after a worker finished a job and
  fix errors right away
- **NEVER create workarounds** - raise issues after 3 failed attempts
- **NEVER compromise on code quality** - no shortcuts, quick fixes, or technical
  debt
- **NEVER import infrastructure into application layer**
- **ALWAYS use DI Container pattern** for dependency injection
- **ALWAYS use orchestrator-worker pattern** for complex tasks (Main Agent
  coordinates, General Agent implements)

### üü° IMPORTANT - Core Workflow

1. Plan with TodoWrite ‚Üí Delegate via Task tool ‚Üí Review with
   commit-readiness-reviewer ‚Üí Handle git operations ‚Üí Complete Post-Commit
   Checklist
2. Write tests before implementation (TDD)
3. Follow existing patterns and conventions
4. Achieve 99%+ test coverage for every layer
5. After creating new files, run lint immediately and address issues right away

### üü¢ HELPFUL - Key Commands

```bash
pnpm test                     # Run all tests
pnpm typecheck                # TypeScript check
pnpm lint                     # ESLint check
pnpm format:check             # Format files
pnpm --filter @twsoftball/domain test    # Domain tests only
```

## Architecture

```

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Frontend**: PWA with Vite + React
- **State Management**: Event Sourcing
- **Database**: IndexedDB (web), SQLite (mobile via Capacitor)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (monorepo)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E)
- **Build**: Vite
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Development Workflow: Orchestrator-Worker Pattern

### Core 5-Step Workflow

1. **Plan & Track**
   - Main Agent creates TodoWrite list for complex tasks
   - Break work into focused, discrete units

2. **Delegate Implementation**
   - Main Agent assigns ALL implementation tasks to General-Purpose Agent via
     Task tool
   - General-Purpose Agent implements using TDD (test ‚Üí code ‚Üí refactor)

3. **Review & Validate**
   - Main Agent triggers commit-readiness-reviewer for quality validation
   - Main Agent summarizes review feedback and displays to user
   - If issues found, delegate ALL fixes to General-Purpose Agent (max 3
     attempts)
   - Always get reviewd again after issues are fixed

4. **Delegate Git Operations**
   - Main Agent delegates ALL git operations to General-Purpose Agent
   - General-Purpose Agent handles git add, commit, pre-commit hook fixes, and
     PR creation

5. **Delegate Documentation Updates**
   - Main Agent delegates Post-Commit Checklist to General-Purpose Agent
   - General-Purpose Agent updates relevant documentation

### Agent Roles

- **Main Agent (Orchestrator)**: Plans with TodoWrite, delegates ALL work,
  triggers reviews, summarizes feedback, monitors progress, escalates issues
  only
- **General-Purpose Agent (Worker)**: Implements ALL tasks with TDD, handles git
  operations, fixes issues, updates documentation, reports back with
  deliverables
- **Commit-Readiness-Reviewer (Validator)**: Validates architecture, checks
  quality gates, returns detailed feedback for main agent to summarize

## üìù Post-Commit Checklist (DELEGATED TO GENERAL-PURPOSE AGENT)

**After every commit, delegate this task to the General-Purpose Agent:**

### Essential Documentation Updates:

1. Update architectural diagrams if package structure changed
2. Add new scripts or commands discovered/created to documentation
3. Update JSDoc examples if novel patterns emerged
4. Run quick verification that documented commands still work
5. Check that file paths mentioned in docs still exist
6. Verify architecture matches actual implementation

**Main Agent Role:** Only delegate this task and verify completion.

## Quality Assurance Philosophy

### No Compromise Principle

- **Technical Excellence First**: Quality is never negotiable, regardless of
  time pressure
- **Proper Solutions Only**: Address root causes, not symptoms
- **Long-term Thinking**: Avoid technical debt that creates future problems
- **Professional Standards**: Maintain enterprise-grade code quality

### When Facing Challenges

1. **First Response**: Find the proper architectural solution
2. **If Blocked**: Document the issue and seek guidance
3. **Never Do**: Create temporary fixes, skip tests, or lower standards
4. **Always Remember**: Clean code is faster to maintain and extend

### Quality Gates That Cannot Be Bypassed

- **Tiered Coverage Thresholds** (layer-specific hard blocks):
  - Domain: 96%+ (business logic integrity)
  - Application: 90%+ (use case reliability)
  - Infrastructure: 80%+ (adapter functionality)
  - Shared: 85%+ (utility reliability)
  - Web: 70%+ (UI baseline)
- TypeScript compilation errors
- ESLint violations (unless properly justified)
- Architecture dependency violations
- Missing documentation for public APIs

## Code Standards

### Architecture Rules

- **Domain layer**: NO dependencies on other layers (pure business logic)
- **Application layer**: Depends only on Domain + uses DI Container pattern
- **Infrastructure layer**: Provides factory implementations for Application
  layer
- **Web layer**: Uses DI Container to access Application services, never imports
  Infrastructure
- **DI Container**: Enterprise-grade dependency injection with service registry,
  lazy loading, and dynamic imports
- **Zero Architecture Exceptions**: Clean dependency boundaries with no
  workarounds needed

**Critical Pattern: DI Container with Dynamic Import**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: DI Container approach
import { createApplicationServicesWithContainer } from '@twsoftball/application';
const services = await createApplicationServicesWithContainer({
  storage: 'indexeddb',
});

// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Web layer importing Infrastructure
import { createIndexedDBFactory } from '@twsoftball/infrastructure/web';
```

### Testing Strategy & Coverage Excellence

#### Tiered Coverage Philosophy: Practical Excellence

**Goal**: 98%+ coverage during implementation **Reality**: Different layers have
different testing challenges **Focus**: Test user stories and critical paths,
not just lines

#### Coverage Tiers by Layer

| Layer              | CI Gate | Target | Rationale                                |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**         | 96%     | 98%+   | Core business logic must be bulletproof  |
| **Application**    | 90%     | 95%+   | Use cases need high confidence           |
| **Infrastructure** | 80%     | 90%+   | External integrations are harder to test |
| **Shared/Utils**   | 85%     | 95%+   | Utilities should be well-tested          |
| **Web/UI**         | 70%     | 85%+   | UI testing has diminishing returns       |

#### Implementation vs Gating Thresholds

**Three-Tier System:**

1. **üö® CI Gates (Hard Block)** - Minimum acceptable quality
   - Protects against regressions
   - Enforced in vitest.config.ts per layer
   - Different standards for different complexities

2. **üéØ Implementation Target** - What we aim for during development
   - Domain: 98%+ (excellence standard)
   - Application: 95%+ (high confidence)
   - Infrastructure: 90%+ (good coverage)
   - Web: 85%+ (reasonable for UI)

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Threshold** - Triggers review but doesn't block
   - 5% below CI gate = Yellow warning
   - 10% below = Red alert + mandatory review

#### Test Priority Matrix

**1. Critical (Must Test)**

- Business rules & domain logic
- Error handling & recovery
- Security boundaries
- Data validation

**2. Important (Should Test)**

- Integration points
- Performance critical paths
- User workflows
- Edge cases

**3. Nice to Have (Could Test)**

- UI animations
- Logging statements
- Simple getters/setters
- Framework boilerplate

**4. Exclusions (Don't Test)**

- Port interfaces (just contracts)
- Type definitions
- Constants
- Third-party integrations (mock instead)

#### Test Types & Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Domain entities, value objects, use cases (Co-located .test.ts
  files)
- **Integration Tests**: Database adapters, application services
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **TDD Required**: Write tests before implementation

#### Pre-Commit Coverage Checklist

```bash
# Check coverage before commit
pnpm test:coverage

# Verify thresholds per layer:
# - Domain layer MUST be 96%+
# - Application layer MUST be 90%+
# - Infrastructure layer MUST be 80%+
# - Shared utilities MUST be 85%+
# - Web/UI layer MUST be 70%+

# New features MUST have scenario tests
# Error paths MUST be tested
# Performance implications MUST be considered
```

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no `any` types
- **ESLint**: Airbnb config with custom rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent formatting
- **Commits**: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, test:, refactor:, docs:)
- **No Compromise Policy**:
  - No quick fixes or temporary solutions
  - No skipping tests to "save time"
  - No relaxing TypeScript strictness
  - No disabling ESLint rules without proper justification

### Documentation Standards (JSDoc Requirements)

- **Class-level documentation**: Every class must have JSDoc explaining purpose
  and business context
- **Method documentation**: Complex methods need examples and @remarks for
  non-obvious logic
- **Domain terminology**: Explain softball-specific terms and business rules
- **Validation rules**: Document not just "what" but "why" - the business reason
  behind constraints

## Automated Review Process

### Review Timing

- After general agent completes implementation tasks
- Before any `git commit` attempt
- After completing TodoWrite milestones
- Before creating pull requests

### Review Workflow

1. **Main Agent**: Triggers commit-readiness-reviewer
2. **Reviewer**: Validates tests, coverage, architecture, documentation
3. **Main Agent**: Summarizes feedback for user transparency
4. **General-Purpose Agent**: Applies all fixes (if needed)
5. **General-Purpose Agent**: Handles git operations when clean

### Review Feedback Display Pattern

```
‚úÖ **Review Summary:**
‚úÖ Tests: All tests passing
‚úÖ Coverage: X% (meets target)
‚úÖ TypeScript: No type errors
‚ö†Ô∏è  Issues: X formatting issues found
üîß **Actions:** Delegating fixes to General-Purpose Agent...
```

## Error Handling & Escalation

### Escalation Protocol

When max attempts (3) exceeded:

1. **Document Issue**: Capture specific error details and attempted solutions
2. **Context Provision**: Show relevant error logs and affected files
3. **User Notification**: Request guidance (no workarounds policy)
4. **Clear Handoff**: Explain what was attempted and current state

### Quality-Related Escalations

When facing quality vs. speed pressure:

1. **Document the quality requirement** that seems challenging
2. **Explain why the proper solution is important** for long-term success
3. **Propose timeline adjustment** rather than quality compromise
4. **Seek architectural guidance** if the proper solution is unclear

## Key Patterns

### Event Sourcing

- All changes stored as events
- Current state derived by replaying events
- Perfect undo/redo support
- Complete audit trail

### Dependency Injection: DI Container with Dynamic Import

**DI Container Implementation**

- **Enterprise Features**: Service registry, lazy loading, circular dependency
  detection
- **Dynamic Imports**: Infrastructure loaded at runtime based on configuration
- **Advanced Lifecycle**: Singleton management, parallel resolution, container
  introspection
- **Runtime Configuration**: Multiple implementations (memory, indexeddb,
  sqlite)

```typescript
// DI Container approach
export async function createApplicationServicesWithContainer(
  config: ApplicationConfig
) {
  const container = new DIContainer();
  await registerInfrastructureServices(container, config);
  await registerApplicationServices(container);
  return await container.resolve<ApplicationServices>('applicationServices');
}
```

### Error Handling

- Domain errors extend DomainError
- Application errors handled at use case level
- Infrastructure errors wrapped appropriately

## Important Notes

- **DI Container Pattern**: Enterprise-grade dependency injection with service
  registry and lifecycle management
- **Never** import Infrastructure directly into Web layer
- **Never** bypass DI Container for dependency injection
- **Never** compromise on architectural principles for convenience
- **Never** skip testing phases or reduce coverage targets
- **Never** use workarounds instead of proper solutions
- **Always** use `createApplicationServicesWithContainer()` for dependency
  injection
- **Always** write tests before implementation (TDD)
- **Always** maintain code quality standards regardless of complexity
- **Always** use orchestrator-worker pattern for complex tasks
- **Main agent coordinates, General-Purpose Agent implements everything**
- **Always trigger commit-readiness-reviewer and summarize results**
- **Delegate ALL git operations and fixes to General-Purpose Agent**

**Architecture Reference**: See `/docs/architecture-patterns.md` for complete DI
Container implementation details
